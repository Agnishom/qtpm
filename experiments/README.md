Evaluation
==========

The Data Set We Use
-------------------

* Settling
    * Signal: traces generated by a [cruise control model](https://github.com/ERATOMMSD/cruise-control-simulink)
    * The input data set consists of these two parts:
        * For the same sampling frequency, change the length.
        * For the same length, use different sampling frequency
    * Pattern: saturation.dot

What we measure
---------------

* result of `/usr/bin/time -v -o [log]  ../build/qtpm -i [timed_word] -f [pattern] --abs > /dev/null 2>&1`
    * For each:
        * signal
        * pattern
    * We can get:
        * execution time
        * memory usage

Scripts
=======

run\_gtime.sh/run\_gtime\_density.sh
---------------------------------

* The script to run an experiment
* This script works both in Linux and Mac

make_tsv.sh
-----------

* The script to make tsv of the summary of the experiment results.
s* The input data is not specified in the script. Therefore, it can be used for both of the data sets.
* This script works both in Linux and Mac
